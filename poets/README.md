[Poets from the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poets_from_the_United_States) scraped from wikipedia. I geocoded what I could, scriptwise, for place of birth and place of death. Not everyone has personal history data in wiki infobox. Project idea....


Static birthplace:
![poets-birthplace](https://github.com/briggsreschke/gis-data/assets/16325768/0de6bd9c-8174-4013-9cd2-001cb3e55cf1)

Todo: add dates to poet records.
